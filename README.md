## üìì **About the project:**

**Apollo Music Review**  is a  music review website built using the flask framework, simultaneously allowing users full C.R.U.D functionality of their own music reviews.

## üíªÔ∏è **Technologies Used:**
___

* **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML):** - Is the main language used in this project which allowed me to correctly structure the website, whereby using best practices to use semantic tags where appropriate.

* **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS):** - Was used via an external stylesheet using best practices to style format and visually present the HTML.

* **[FLASK](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/):** - A python framework 

* **[PYTHON](https://www.python.org/):** - Python is a backend programming language

* **[MONGODB](https://www.mongodb.com/):** - MongoDB is a NoSQL database, based on JSON format, using key value pairs to store data in clusters / collections, which can be retrieved via Python.


* **[JAVASCRIPT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript):** - *As part of Bootstrap* Javascript although i havent programmed it, was included in the site as part of the Bootstrap framework so that some Bootstrap components such as the navigation toggler would work.

* **[JQUERY](https://jquery.com/):** - *Extensive parts of the web application are programmed in jquery, click event listeners on page loads and loading of the users data all employ the use of jQuery.*

* **[BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/):** - The framework for the site allowing use of the Bootstrap grid and responsive mobile first approach. I Used many components from Bootstrap mainly, the Carousel, Nav bar, forms and modals. 
* **[MDBOOTSTRAP](https://mdbootstrap.com/):** - The framework based on Google Material Design for Bootstrap. 

* **[GITPOD](https://gitpod.io/):** - IDE for this project. Allowed me to fork the Code Institute template from Github and open in Gitpod so that all extenstions were available.

* **[GIT](https://git-scm.com/):** Git employed as version control

* **[GITHUB](https://github.com/):** - Github was used to host the repository for this project.

* **[SQUOOSH](https://squoosh.app/):** - I used Squoosh in order to reduce the image sizes

* **[PHOTOSHOP](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html):** - For editing images associated with this project.

* **[BALSAMIQ](https://balsamiq.com/):** - Mac version to develop wireframes for this project.

* **[CHROME](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/):** - Not only did i use Chrome extensively for testing and bug fixing but I used the following extensions :

* **[PESTICIDE](https://www.google.com):** -  This extension inserts (with auto reload) the Pesticide CSS into the current page, outlining each element. - Giving a good visual representation of containers rows etc, as i was using material design from MDBootstrap i was inserting containers in to containers in points to get the desired layout and style, this extension allowed me to view the layout correctly. 

* **[RESPONSIVE VIEWER](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb):** -  An excellent extension suggested to me by my Mentor Allen - A Chrome extension to show multiple screens in one view. the extension will help front-end developers to test multiple screens while developing responsive websites/applications.

* **[GIFY](https://giphy.com/):** - Used to create the .gif file in readme depicting the responsive viewer in action and showing my testing on different screen sizes. 

* **[WEB FONT GENERATOR](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator):** - Used to bring in a custom font i wanted to use for the main H1/ H2 sections, custom branding.

* **[AM I RESPONSIVE](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/):** - Used to generate the header image displayed at top of Readme.md file depicting 4 screen displays.

## üßë‚Äçüé® **UX:** **User Experience Design (UX)**

 __Developed from the code institute full stack web developer module on UX design.__

**What is UX:**

User Experience Design is the work, processes and skillsets involved in creating useful useable products which provide value not only to the customer but the business owner ensuring that a product not only works but is intuitive, simple, and enjoyable to use.. A good UX experience is achieved by following a defined process called User Centred Design or UCD for short.

I haven chosen to create a music review website with full C.R.U.D functionality and also login and registration forms, complete with password hashing from **Werkseug** following best practice UX principals and will apply them to reassess the current needs and wants of my customers and future potential clients.

I felt like tackling a business which I am currently involved in would give me a better understanding of implementing UX principals which will then allow me to generate better UX designs in the future with a stronger understanding of the core principals.

I will aim to cover the different planes in detail so that this document can be used as a blueprint for future UX development I undertake.


## üí° **Strategy plane: The Initial idea.**
___
The basis behind the Apollo Music review site, was to start a flask web app which allows users to search for music reviews, wether this is a professional release, from EDM to house music, to contemporary and amateur releases. In a very easy and intuitive and visual was regarding UX. My primary aim was to bring together many of the technologies i have learned so far to then use these technologies and display data in a comprehensive way. I aim to bring in user generated data using forms (through a Add review form page) and python linked to MongoDB so that my web app has the ability to expand and grow with ease as users can
